## Troubleshooting

### Common Problems

#### "Cannot Connect to Server"

**Symptoms**: Browser shows "can't reach this page"

**Solutions**:
1. Check server is running: Look for "Server running on..." message
2. Verify address: Use `http://localhost:5000` locally
3. Check firewall: Ensure port 5000 is allowed
4. Try different port: Edit configuration if 5000 is in use

#### "Authentication Required" Loop

**Symptoms**: Keeps asking for password

**Solutions**:
1. Verify credentials: Check username and password
2. Check password hash: Ensure hash in `.env` is correct
3. Try password generator again: `python generate_password.py`
4. Check browser cookies: Clear browser data

#### Videos Won't Play

**Symptoms**: Player shows but video doesn't start

**Solutions**:
1. **Check format**: Ensure browser supports video format
   - Convert to MP4 for best compatibility
2. **Check file integrity**: Verify video file isn't corrupted
3. **Check permissions**: Ensure server can read video files
4. **Try different browser**: Chrome/Edge have best codec support

#### Slow Streaming

**Symptoms**: Videos buffer frequently or take long to start

**Solutions**:
1. **Check network**: Test internet speed
2. **Increase threads**: `VIDEO_SERVER_THREADS=12` in config
3. **Check file size**: Very large files (>4GB) may be slow
4. **Local network**: Use local IP for better speed

#### "Path Not Found" Errors

**Symptoms**: Folders or files show as not found

**Solutions**:
1. **Check video directory**: Ensure path in config is correct
2. **Check permissions**: Server must have read access
3. **Check file names**: Avoid special characters
4. **Refresh browser**: Clear browser cache

### Advanced Troubleshooting

#### Log Analysis

**Application logs**: `logs/app.log`
```bash
tail -f logs/app.log  # Monitor in real-time
```

**Security logs**: `logs/security.log`
```bash
grep "authentication" logs/security.log  # Check login attempts
```

**Error logs**: `logs/error.log`
```bash
tail -20 logs/error.log  # See recent errors
```

#### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed information:

```bash
# In .env file
VIDEO_SERVER_DEBUG=true
VIDEO_SERVER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

**Warning**: Debug mode logs sensitive information. Don't use in production.

#### Network Debugging

```bash
# Check if port is open
netstat -an | grep 5000         # Windows/Linux
lsof -i :5000                   # macOS/Linux

# Test local connectivity
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Test external connectivity
curl http://your-public-ip:5000/health
```

#### Performance Debugging

```bash
# Monitor resource usage
top                             # Linux/macOS
tasklist | findstr python      # Windows

# Check disk space
df -h                           # Linux/macOS
dir                            # Windows
```
